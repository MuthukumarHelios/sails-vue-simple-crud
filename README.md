# sails-vue-simple-crud

A simple CRUD application built with Sails and Vue.

To clone repo:

    git clone https://github.com/craigvantonder/sails-vue-simple-crud.git
    cd sails-vue-simple-crud

To install node modules:

    npm install

To ensure that grunt has copied vue as into place and that the linker reflects this:

    sails lift
    ...Wait for server to start...
    Ctrl C
    ...Closed the server...
    sails lift

From this point you can use the application via `http://localhost:1337/`.
